---

## üé® Step 4: Generate Your First Image

### Basic Text-to-Image

Simply ask the AI to create an image:

**Example Prompts:**

```
Generate an image of a cozy coffee shop on a rainy day
```

```
Create a photorealistic portrait of a wise old wizard with a long white beard
```

```
Make me a poster for a music festival with the text "Summer Vibes 2025"
```

### Tips for Better Results

#### ‚úÖ DO: Use Descriptive, Narrative Prompts

**Good Example:**
```
A photorealistic close-up of a steaming cup of coffee on a wooden table. 
The scene is illuminated by soft morning light streaming through a window, 
creating warm golden tones. The coffee has beautiful latte art in the shape 
of a heart. Shot with an 85mm lens with a blurred background.
```

#### ‚ùå DON'T: Use Keyword Lists

**Bad Example:**
```
coffee, table, wood, morning, light, latte art, heart
```

---

## üéØ Advanced Usage

### 1. Photorealistic Images

For realistic photos, use photography terminology:

```
A photorealistic wide-angle shot of a modern minimalist living room. 
The space features floor-to-ceiling windows with natural daylight, 
a grey sectional sofa, and indoor plants. Captured with a 24mm lens, 
emphasizing the spaciousness. Architectural photography style.
```

**Key Elements:**
- Shot type: close-up, wide-angle, bird's eye view
- Lighting: golden hour, soft diffused, dramatic shadows
- Camera details: 85mm lens, bokeh background, shallow depth of field
- Mood: serene, dramatic, cheerful, moody

### 2. Text in Images

Gemini excels at generating legible text:

```
Create a vintage-style poster for a jazz club. The poster should have 
"Blue Note Jazz Club" in elegant art deco typography at the top, 
"Every Friday Night" in smaller text below, and "Live Music & Cocktails" 
at the bottom. Dark blue background with gold accents.
```

### 3. Image Editing

You can modify existing images (if supported by your setup):

```
[Upload an image of a room]
Change the wall color to sage green and add some framed artwork
```

### 4. Iterative Refinement

Have a conversation to perfect your image:

**Turn 1:**
```
Create a logo for a tech startup called "CloudSync"
```

**Turn 2:**
```
Make the colors more vibrant and add a cloud icon
```

**Turn 3:**
```
Perfect! Now make it work on a dark background
```

---

## üìê Aspect Ratios

You can specify aspect ratios for your images:

- **1:1** - Square (Instagram posts, profile pictures)
- **16:9** - Landscape (YouTube thumbnails, presentations)
- **9:16** - Portrait (Instagram stories, mobile wallpapers)
- **4:3** - Standard landscape
- **3:4** - Standard portrait (posters, book covers)

**Example:**
```
Generate a 3:4 portrait poster for a coffee brand with the text "Morning Brew"
```

**Note**: Gemini may not strictly enforce aspect ratios, but it will try to match your request.

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Start with Clear Descriptions
Instead of: "a cat"
Try: "A fluffy orange tabby cat sitting on a windowsill, looking out at a rainy street. Soft natural light from the window illuminates its fur."

### 2. Use Photography Language
- Mention lighting: "golden hour light", "soft diffused lighting"
- Specify camera: "85mm portrait lens", "wide-angle shot"
- Describe mood: "serene atmosphere", "dramatic and moody"

### 3. Iterate and Refine
Don't expect perfection on the first try. Have a conversation:
- Generate initial image
- Ask for specific changes
- Refine until satisfied

### 4. Leverage Text Generation
Gemini is excellent at text in images:
- Logos with company names
- Posters with event details
- Signs and labels
- Diagrams with annotations

### 5. Specify Composition
- "Centered composition"
- "Rule of thirds"
- "Subject in foreground, blurred background"
- "Bird's eye view"
